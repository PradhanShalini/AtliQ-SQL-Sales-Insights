Generate a monthly aggregated product-level sales report for Croma India customers for Fiscal Year 2021.
The report is structured to include the following fields:
1)Month
2)Product Name
3)Variant
4)Sold Quantity
5)Gross Price Per Item
6)Gross Price Total

Retrieve Monthly gross sales report for any customer

#Instead of writing separate queries for each customer like Zepto, Flipkart, or Neptune, we can use a Stored Procedure to retrieve data for any set of customers.

#Create the stored procedure

Create a stored procedure that assigns a market badge to each region based on its total sold quantity.
Badge Logic: If a region's total sold quantity exceeds 5 million units, assign it a 'Gold' badge; otherwise, assign 'Silver'.

Generate a bar chart report that visualizes the Top 10 Customers in Fiscal Year 2021 based on their total net sales.

#We use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) for reusability and to separate sales aggregation from percentage calculations. The final output is exported as a CSV and visualized using a bar chart.

Create a stored procedure that returns the top N products based on total net sales for a specified fiscal year.

-->SOLUTION

CREATE PROCEDURE `top_product_by_netsales`( 
         in_fiscal_year INT,
         in_top_n INT
       )
BEGIN
SELECT 
     product, 
     ROUND(SUM(net_sales)/1000000,2) as net_sales_mln		
FROM net_sales n
WHERE fiscal_year = in_fiscal_year
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY net_sales_mln DESC
LIMIT in_top_n;
END;

By using a stored procedure, you gain flexibility and reusability. When executed, the stored procedure allows you to specify any fiscal year and dynamically choose the Top N products or markets (e.g., Top 5, 10, or 20), based on your business requirement. This makes it more scalable and adaptable compared to writing a hardcoded query each time.
